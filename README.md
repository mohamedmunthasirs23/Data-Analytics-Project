Analyzing Historical Stock Market Data
This project analyzes historical stock market data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations. Using ARIMA and LSTM models, it predicts future stock prices while demonstrating the practical applications of data science in financial markets.

Features
Data Preprocessing

Load and clean historical stock data.
Perform time series stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
Visualization

Plot stock closing prices over time.
Compare actual vs predicted values in ARIMA and LSTM models.
Time Series Modeling

ARIMA Model for short-term stock price forecasting.
LSTM Model for capturing sequential dependencies in stock price data.
Performance Evaluation

Visualize model predictions compared to actual stock prices.
